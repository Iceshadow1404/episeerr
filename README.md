<img src="static/logo_icon.png" alt="OCDarr Lite" width="120" align="right"/>

**The essential OCDarr experience** - focused on what matters most: intelligent, rule-based episode management that responds to your viewing habits.

## What OCDarr Lite Does

OCDarr Lite automatically manages your TV episodes based on **your viewing activity**. Watch an episode, and OCDarr intelligently prepares what you want to watch next while cleaning up what you've already seen.

### üéØ **Perfect For:**
- Users who **don't rewatch** episodes but want the next one ready
- People who prefer a **curated, organized** library over massive collections
- Anyone wanting **different management strategies** for different shows
- Users who value **automation that actually helps**

### üö´ **Not For:**
- Digital hoarders who want to keep everything forever
- Users who rewatch content frequently
- Large household servers with multiple users at different points in series

## üîß How It Works

### **Simple Three-Step Process:**

1. **Create Rules** ‚Üí Define how episodes should be managed
2. **Assign Series** ‚Üí Link your shows to specific rules  
3. **Watch & Enjoy** ‚Üí OCDarr handles everything automatically

### **Rule Components:**

Each rule defines exactly how episodes are handled:

| Component | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Get Option** | How many upcoming episodes to prepare | `1` (next episode), `season` (full season), `all` (everything) |
| **Action Option** | How episodes are handled | `monitor` (passive), `search` (active download) |
| **Keep Watched** | What to retain after viewing | `1` (last episode), `season` (current season), `all` (everything) |
| **Monitor Watched** | Track episodes after watching | `true` (keep monitoring), `false` (auto-unmonitor) |

### **Example Rule - "Next Episode Only":**
```
Get Option: 1          ‚Üí Prepare just the next episode
Action Option: search  ‚Üí Actively download it  
Keep Watched: 1        ‚Üí Keep only the last watched episode
Monitor Watched: false ‚Üí Stop tracking after watching
```

**Result:** Watch S1E5 ‚Üí Keeps E5, gets E6, deletes E4 and earlier

5. **Purpose:** Protection while OCDarr processes rules

### **Jellyseerr/Overseerr Integration**
