## What It Does

Episeerr automates your TV library with three simple features:

🎯 **Episode Selection** - Choose exactly which episodes you want  
⚡ **Smart Rules** - Next episode ready when you watch, old episodes cleaned up  
💾 **Storage Gate** - Automatic cleanup when storage gets low

## Quick Start

### Minimal Setup (Just Episode Selection)
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  episeerr:
    image: vansmak/episeerr:latest
    environment:
      # Only 3 required for basic episode selection
      - SONARR_URL=http://your-sonarr:8989
      - SONARR_API_KEY=your_sonarr_api_key
      - TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
      - ./logs:/app/logs
    ports:
      - "5002:5002"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Full Setup (All Features)
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  episeerr:
    image: vansmak/episeerr:latest
    environment:
      # Required for all features
      - SONARR_URL=http://your-sonarr:8989
      - SONARR_API_KEY=your_sonarr_api_key
      - TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
      
      # Add these ONLY if you want viewing automation
      - TAUTULLI_URL=http://your-tautulli:8181
      - TAUTULLI_API_KEY=your_tautulli_key
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
      - ./logs:/app/logs
    ports:
      - "5002:5002"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Basic Setup (Works Immediately)
1. **Start container** and go to `http://your-server:5002`
2. **That's it!** You can now use episode selection

### Optional Additions (Add Only What You Want)
- **Storage cleanup**: Set threshold in Scheduler page
- **Smart rules**: Create rules for automatic management
- **Viewing automation**: Add webhooks for next episode ready

## How It Works

### Smart Rules (NEW!)
Create rules with the new dropdown system:

**Get Episodes:**
- Type: Episodes/Seasons/All + Count
- Example: "3 episodes" = next 3 episodes ready

**Keep Episodes:**  
- Type: Episodes/Seasons/All + Count
- Example: "1 season" = keep current season after watching

### Grace Periods (NEW!)
Create rules with two independent grace timers:

**Grace Watched (Rotating Collection):**  
- Your kept episodes expire after X days of inactivity
- Example: 14 days = favorites rotate out after 2 weeks

**Grace Unwatched (Watch Deadlines):**
- New episodes get X days from download to be watched
- Example: 10 days = pressure to watch new content


**Dormant Timer (NEW!):**
- Removes content from abandoned shows 
- Example: 30 days = if no activity for a month, clean up the show

### Example: Popular Show Rule
```
Get: 5 episodes (next 5 episodes ready)
Keep: 2 episodes (last 2 watched episodes)
Grace: 7 days (keep last 2 watched episodes, delete others after a week)
Dormant: 60 days (cleanup if abandoned for 2 months)
```

**What happens:**
1. Watch E10 → Get E11-E15, Keep E9-E10, Delete E1-E8
2. After 7 days → Delete E7-E8 (grace expired), Library: E9-E15
3. After 60 days no activity → Delete show (series abandoned)

### Storage Gate
- Set one global threshold: "Keep 20GB free"
- Cleanup only runs when below threshold
- Stops immediately when back above threshold
- Only affects shows with grace/dormant timers
