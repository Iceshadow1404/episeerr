# OCDarr: Smart Episode Management for Sonarr

**Intelligent, time-aware episode management** that responds to your viewing habits and automatically maintains your library based on activity patterns.

## What OCDarr Does

OCDarr automatically manages your TV episodes based on **your viewing activity and time-based rules**. Watch an episode, and OCDarr intelligently prepares what you want next while cleaning up what you've already seen.

### üéØ **Perfect For:**
- Users who **don't rewatch** episodes but want the next one ready
- People who prefer a **curated, organized** library over massive collections
- Anyone wanting **different management strategies** for different shows
- Shows with **different viewing cadences** (daily, weekly, seasonal)

---

## üîß How It Works

### **Flexible Rule System:**
Each rule defines exactly how episodes are handled:

| Component | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Get Option** | How many upcoming episodes to prepare | `1` (next episode), `season` (full season), `all` (everything) |
| **Action Option** | How episodes are handled | `monitor` (passive), `search` (active download) |
| **Keep Watched** | What to retain as a "keep block" | `1` (last episode), `season` (current season), `all` (everything) |
| **Grace Period** | Days after watching before cleanup | `7` (cleanup after 1 week), `null` (never) |
| **Dormant Timer** | Days without activity before aggressive cleanup | `90` (abandon after 3 months), `null` (never) |

### **Two-Layer System:**
**üöÄ Webhook Layer:** Responds instantly to viewing activity
- Tracks what you watched and when
- Prepares next episodes immediately  
- Cleans up old episodes (sliding window)

**‚è∞ Scheduler Layer:** Handles time-based cleanup
- **Grace Period:** Selective cleanup after X days (maintains continuity)
- **Dormant Timer:** Aggressive cleanup after Y days (reclaims storage)

### **Example: "Weekly Show with Buffer"**
```
Get: 3, Search, Keep: 3
Grace Period: 7 days, Dormant Timer: 60 days
```
- **Watch S1E5** ‚Üí Keeps E3,E4,E5, gets E6,E7,E8, deletes E1,E2
- **7 days later** ‚Üí Cleans up old episodes before keep block
- **60 days no activity** ‚Üí Nukes most episodes (show abandoned)

## üéõÔ∏è Use Cases

### **Grace/Dormant Cleanup Only** (No Webhooks)
Perfect for users who just want time-based cleanup:
```
Grace Period: 14 days    ‚Üí Clean up bi-weekly
Dormant Timer: 90 days   ‚Üí Abandon after 3 months
```
*OCDarr runs scheduled cleanup every 6 hours, no webhook setup needed*

### **Webhook Only** (No Time Cleanup)
Perfect for immediate episode management:
```
Get: 1, Search, Keep: 1
Grace Period: null, Dormant Timer: null
```
*Sliding window of episodes, no automatic time-based deletion*

### **Full System** (Webhooks + Time Cleanup)
Complete automation with both layers:
```
Get: 2, Search, Keep: 2
Grace Period: 7 days, Dormant Timer: 30 days
```
*Immediate management + intelligent time-based cleanup*

### **Archive Mode** (Keep Everything)
For shows you want to preserve:
```
Get: all, Monitor, Keep: all
Grace Period: null, Dormant Timer: null
```
*Downloads everything, never deletes anything*

## üö´ What OCDarr Won't Do

- **Manage unassigned series** - OCDarr completely ignores shows without rules
- **Interfere with manual Sonarr settings** - Your existing configurations remain untouched
- **Download without permission** - Only monitors/searches based on your rules
- **Delete without reason** - All deletions are logged with clear reasoning

---

## üí° Philosophy

> *"OCDarr isn't about having everything - it's about having exactly what you need, exactly when you need it, and automatically letting go of what you don't."*

**Use as much or as little as you want:**
- Just need time-based cleanup? Skip webhooks
- Just want immediate episode management? Skip timers  
- Want full automation? Use everything
- Have some shows you want untouched? Don't assign them rules

**The two-timer system reflects how we actually consume media:** we stay current with active shows (grace period cleanup) but eventually abandon series we lose interest in (dormant timer cleanup).
