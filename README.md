# Episeerr

**Smart episode management system for Sonarr** - Three independent automation solutions with intelligent storage management.

## What Episeerr Does

Episeerr gives you precise control over your TV episodes with three separate systems that work together or independently, plus a global storage gate that keeps your library size under control.

### 🎯 **Three Solutions + Smart Storage**

| Solution | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **🎬 Granular Episode Requests** | Select exactly which episodes you want | Want specific episodes, not full seasons |
| **⚡ Viewing-Based Rules** | Auto-manage episodes when you watch | Want next episode ready, cleanup watched ones |
| **⏰ Time-Based Cleanup** | Clean up based on age and activity | Want automatic library maintenance |
| **💾 Global Storage Gate** | One threshold controls all cleanup | Want simple, safe storage management |

**Use any combination** - or just one solution that fits your needs.

## 💾 Global Storage Gate (NEW!)

**One simple setting controls all cleanup across your entire library.**

### How It Works
1. **Set one global threshold** (e.g., "20GB free space")
2. **Cleanup only runs when below threshold** (smart, not wasteful)
3. **Stops when back above threshold** (surgical precision)
4. **Only affects rules with grace/dormant settings** (safe by default)

### The "Chips" Philosophy
- 🟡 **Grace Period:** "Take my chips off the table" - Remove unwatched episodes while keeping your viewing context
- 🔴 **Dormant Timer:** "Remove chips from the bank" - Show abandoned, aggressive cleanup to reclaim storage
- 🛡️ **Protected Rules:** Rules without timers = never touched (your permanent collection)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Docker Compose
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  episeerr:
    image: vansmak/episeerr:latest
    environment:
      # Required
      - SONARR_URL=http://your-sonarr:8989
      - SONARR_API_KEY=your_sonarr_api_key
      - TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
      
      # Optional - Viewing-based rules
      - TAUTULLI_URL=http://your-tautulli:8181
      - TAUTULLI_API_KEY=your_tautulli_key
      # OR
      - JELLYFIN_URL=http://your-jellyfin:8096
      - JELLYFIN_API_KEY=your_jellyfin_key
      
      # Optional - Request integration
      - JELLYSEERR_URL=http://your-jellyseerr:5055
      - JELLYSEERR_API_KEY=your_jellyseerr_key
      
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
      - ./logs:/app/logs
    ports:
      - "5002:5002"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Setup
1. **Configure:** `http://your-server:5002` - Web interface for management
2. **Set global storage gate** - One threshold for smart cleanup
3. **Create rules** for automated episode management  
4. **Assign series** to rules (unassigned series are ignored)
5. **Optional:** Set up webhooks for viewing-based automation
