# Episeerr

**Backend episode management system for Sonarr** - Three independent automation solutions.

## What Episeerr Does

Episeerr gives you precise control over your TV episodes with three separate systems that can work together or independently:

### üéØ **Three Solutions, One App**

| Solution | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **üé¨ Granular Episode Requests** | Select exactly which episodes you want | Want specific episodes, not full seasons |
| **‚ö° Viewing-Based Rules** | Auto-manage episodes when you watch | Want next episode ready, cleanup watched ones |
| **‚è∞ Time-Based Cleanup** | Clean up based on age and activity | Want automatic library maintenance |

**Use any combination** - or just one solution that fits your needs.

---

## üé¨ Granular Episode Requests

Select individual episodes across multiple seasons with precision.

**Perfect for:**
- Getting just pilot episodes to try shows
- Catching up on specific episodes you missed
- Managing limited storage with surgical precision

**How it works:**
1.  Make request with `episeerr_select` tag in Jellyseerr/Overseerr/sonarr 
2. Choose seasons and specific episodes in episeerr 
3. Only selected episodes are monitored and downloaded

---

## ‚ö° Viewing-Based Rules

Episodes automatically managed based on your viewing activity.

**Perfect for:**
- Always having the next episode ready
- Automatic cleanup of watched episodes
- Different strategies for different shows

**Example rule:** *"Keep last 2 episodes, get next 3, search immediately"*
- Watch S01E05 ‚Üí Keeps E04+E05, gets E06+E07+E08, deletes E01+E02+E03

**Requires:** Plex+Tautulli or Jellyfin webhook setup

---

## ‚è∞ Time-Based Cleanup

Automatic cleanup based on time and viewing patterns.

**Perfect for:**
- Cleaning up shows you've abandoned
- Maintaining library size automatically
- Different retention for active vs dormant shows

**Two timers:**
- **Grace Period:** Cleanup after X days (keeps current viewing context)
- **Dormant Timer:** Aggressive cleanup after Y days (reclaims storage from abandoned shows)

**No webhooks required** - runs on schedule

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Docker Compose
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  episeerr:
    image: vansmak/episeerr:latest
    environment:
      - SONARR_URL=http://your-sonarr:8989
      - SONARR_API_KEY=your_api_key
      - TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_key # For episode selection UI
      # Optional - for viewing-based rules
      - TAUTULLI_URL=http://your-tautulli:8181
      - TAUTULLI_API_KEY=your_tautulli_key
      # Optional - for request integration  
      - JELLYSEERR_URL=http://your-jellyseerr:5055
      - JELLYSEERR_API_KEY=your_jellyseerr_key
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
      - ./logs:/app/logs
    ports:
      - "5002:5002"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Setup
1. **Configure:** `http://your-server:5002` - Basic web interface for rule management
2. **Create rules** for automated episode management  
3. **Assign series** to rules (unassigned series are ignored)
4. **Optional:** Set up webhooks for viewing-based automation

---

## üéõÔ∏è Example Configurations

### Episode Requests Only
Perfect for trying new shows or specific episode management.
```
No rules needed - just use the episode selection interface

Webhooks: Tautulli or Jellyfin, Jellyseer or Overseer
```

### Viewing Rules Only  
Next episode always ready, automatic cleanup.
```
Rule: Get 1, Search, Keep 1
Webhooks: Tautulli or Jellyfin
Timers: null
```

### Time Cleanup Only
Hands-off library maintenance.
```
Rule: Get blank, Monitor, Keep blank
  - or leave like default sonarr 
  - won't matter if no we hook setup  
Grace: 30 days, Dormant: 90 days
Webhooks: Not needed
```

### Full Automation
Complete episode lifecycle management.
```
Intercept and manage requests
Rule: Get 2, Search, Keep 2
Grace: 7 days, Dormant: 60 days  
Webhooks: Enabled
```
