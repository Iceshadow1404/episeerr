# OCDarr: Smart Episode Management for Sonarr

<img src="static/logo_icon.png" alt="OCDarr" width="120" align="right"/>

**Intelligent, time-aware episode management** that responds to your viewing habits and automatically maintains your library based on activity patterns.

## What OCDarr Does

OCDarr automatically manages your TV episodes based on **your viewing activity and time-based rules**. Watch an episode, and OCDarr intelligently prepares what you want next while cleaning up what you've already seen - with smart cleanup timers that adapt to your viewing patterns.

### üéØ **Perfect For:**
- Users who **don't rewatch** episodes but want the next one ready
- People who prefer a **curated, organized** library over massive collections
- Anyone wanting **different management strategies** for different shows
- Users who value **automation with intelligent cleanup**
- Shows with **different viewing cadences** (daily, weekly, seasonal)

### üö´ **Not For:**
- Digital hoarders who want to keep everything forever
- Users who rewatch content frequently
- Large household servers with multiple users at different points in series

---

## üîß How It Works

### **Two-Layer System:**

**üöÄ Webhook Layer (Instant):** Responds to viewing activity
- Tracks what you watched and when
- Prepares next episodes immediately
- Fast response, no delays

**‚è∞ Scheduler Layer (Periodic):** Handles time-based cleanup  
- Surgical cleanup for active shows (maintains viewing continuity) 
- Nuclear cleanup for abandoned shows (reclaims storage)
- Runs every 6 hours (configurable)

### **Rule Components:**

Each rule defines exactly how episodes are handled:



| Component | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Get Option** | How many upcoming episodes to prepare | `1` (next episode), `season` (full season), `all` (everything) |
| **Action Option** | How episodes are handled | `monitor` (passive), `search` (active download) |
| **Keep Watched** | What to retain as a "keep block" | `1` (last episode), `season` (current season), `all` (everything) |
| **Monitor Watched** | Track episodes after watching | `true` (keep monitoring), `false` (auto-unmonitor) |
| **Grace Period** | Days after watching before surgical cleanup | `7` (cleanup after 1 week), `null` (never) |
| **Abandonment Timer** | Days without activity before nuclear cleanup | `90` (abandon after 3 months), `null` (never) |

> **üéõÔ∏è Control Choice:** OCDarr only manages series with assigned rules. Want to keep a show exactly as Sonarr handles it by default? Simply don't assign it to any rule - OCDarr will completely ignore it.


### **Time-Based Cleanup Logic:**

**üîπ Surgical Cleanup (Grace Period):**
- Triggered: X days after last viewing activity
- Action: Delete episodes BEFORE the "keep block" 
- Purpose: Maintain viewing continuity while cleaning up old episodes
- Example: Keep block of 3 episodes, delete everything before that block

**üí• Nuclear Cleanup (Abandonment Timer):**
- Triggered: X days without ANY viewing activity
- Action: Delete most/all episodes (based on keep_watched setting)
- Purpose: Reclaim storage from truly abandoned shows
- Example: No activity for 90 days = show is abandoned, nuke it

### **Example Rule - "Weekly Viewer with Buffer":**
```
Get Option: 3              ‚Üí Prepare next 3 episodes
Action Option: search      ‚Üí Actively download them
Keep Watched: 3            ‚Üí Keep block of 3 episodes
Monitor Watched: false     ‚Üí Stop tracking after watching
Grace Period: 7 days       ‚Üí Clean up old episodes after 1 week
Abandonment Timer: 60 days ‚Üí Nuke show if unwatched for 2 months
```

**Behavior:**
- **Watch S1E5** ‚Üí Keeps E3,E4,E5 (keep block), gets E6,E7,E8 (next episodes)
- **7 days later** ‚Üí Surgical cleanup: Delete E1,E2 (before keep block)
- **60 days no activity** ‚Üí Nuclear cleanup: Delete most episodes (abandonment detected)

### **OCDarr Tag (Optional)**
For power users who want episode-level control from day one:

- **Auto-created:** OCDarr creates an "ocdarr" tag in Sonarr on first run
- **User choice:** Add tag when requesting new series for immediate control
- **Self-cleaning:** Tag automatically removed after processing
- **Delayed downloads:** Prevents Sonarr from auto-downloading full seasons

#### **How to Use:**
1. **Request new series** ‚Üí Optionally add "ocdarr" tag
2. **OCDarr processes** ‚Üí Applies rules, removes tag
3. **Clean operation** ‚Üí No permanent tag clutter

#### **Sonarr Delayed Profile Setup (Recommended):**
1. **Settings** ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí Add Delay Profile
2. **Delay:** 10519200 minutes (failsafe - prevents unwanted downloads)
3. **Tags:** Select "ocdarr"
4. **Bypass:** Do NOT select
5. **Purpose:** Protection while OCDarr processes rules

### **Jellyseerr/Overseerr Integration**
- **With "ocdarr" tag:** Request gets deleted after processing (prevents conflicts)
- **Without tag:** Normal workflow, rules apply after viewing
- **Trade-off:** Choose episode control OR seerr visibility (not both)

### **Scheduler Administration**
- **View Status:** Check last cleanup time and next scheduled run
- **Force Cleanup:** Manually trigger cleanup outside schedule
- **Activity Tracking:** View per-series activity timestamps
- **Logs:** Detailed cleanup operations and reasoning

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Episodes Not Updating After Watching:**
- ‚úÖ Verify webhook configuration in Tautulli/Jellyfin
- ‚úÖ Check OCDarr logs: `/app/logs/app.log`
- ‚úÖ Ensure series has a rule assigned
- ‚úÖ Confirm webhook is reaching OCDarr
- ‚úÖ Check activity tracking file: `data/activity_tracking.json`

### **Time-Based Cleanup Not Working:**
- ‚úÖ Verify scheduler is running in OCDarr interface
- ‚úÖ Check rule has grace period or abandonment timer set
- ‚úÖ Review cleanup logs for specific series
- ‚úÖ Ensure enough time has passed since last activity

### **Rules Not Applying:**
- ‚úÖ Verify series is assigned to a rule in OCDarr interface
- ‚úÖ Check that series isn't manually configured in Sonarr
- ‚úÖ Review rule configuration for correct options
- ‚úÖ **No rule assigned = no action taken** - OCDarr completely ignores unassigned series

### **New Series Downloading Everything:**
- ‚úÖ Set up Sonarr webhook for auto-rule assignment
- ‚úÖ Configure delayed release profile with "ocdarr" tag
- ‚úÖ Use "ocdarr" tag when requesting series for immediate control

## üé™ Why OCDarr?

### **The Problem:**
Most media tools work on "all or nothing" - download entire seasons, keep everything forever, manual cleanup. Time-based management is either non-existent or overly simplistic.

### **The Solution:**  
**Smart, viewing-driven automation with intelligent time-based cleanup** that adapts to how you actually watch TV and manages storage based on activity patterns.

### **The Result:**
- ‚ú® **Always ready:** Next episode available when you want it
- üßπ **Automatically organized:** Old episodes cleaned up intelligently based on time and activity
- üéØ **Personalized:** Different rules and timers for different shows
- ‚ö° **Efficient:** Only downloads what you'll actually watch
- üïí **Time-aware:** Cleanup happens based on your actual viewing patterns
- üîÑ **Adaptive:** Different cleanup strategies for active vs abandoned shows

---

## üí° Philosophy

> *"OCDarr isn't about having everything - it's about having exactly what you need, exactly when you need it, and automatically letting go of what you don't."*

OCDarr is for the **thoughtful media manager** - someone who values:
- **Curation over collection**
- **Automation over accumulation** 
- **Time-awareness over static rules**
- **Purpose over hoarding**
- **Viewing patterns over arbitrary limits**

**The two-timer system reflects how we actually consume media:** we stay current with active shows (surgical cleanup with grace periods) but eventually abandon series we lose interest in (nuclear cleanup with abandonment detection).
